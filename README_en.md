Wumpus World is a game based on the famous logic problem in artificial intelligence. The player navigates through a grid world, trying to avoid dangers such as pits and the terrible Wumpus while searching for a treasure of gold.

## Description

In Wumpus World, the player moves a character through a 4x4 grid, where each cell may contain a danger or treasure. The objective is to find the gold and return to the starting point without falling into pits or being eaten by the Wumpus. The game is a great example of logical reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty.

### Features
